## 🕯️ About the Game

In the cursed land of **Dreadvale**, the veil between worlds has rotted away.  
A mysterious plague whispers through the fog—infecting minds, warping beasts, and resurrecting nightmares.

Every sunrise brings fragile hope.  
Every nightfall awakens the horrors that crawl just beyond sight.

Explore a **procedurally generated open world** twisted by darkness.  
Fight **spectral horrors**, **mutated beasts**, and **corrupted souls**.  
Scavenge, survive, and uncover the truth of the **Whisperplague**.

You're alone—or so you think.

> **Will you defy the dark… or surrender to it?**  
> 🕯️ *"Light fades. Dread remains."* 🔥🔥
